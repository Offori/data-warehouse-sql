## Naming Convention

### Bronze Rules
- All names should start with the source system name and table names must match their original names without renaming  
- sourcesystem_entity
  - sourcesystem: name of the source system (e.g: crm, erp)
  - entity: exact name from the source system
  - Example: crm_customer_sytem -> Customer informations from crm system
 
### Gild Rules
- All names should start from the source system name and table names must match the original names without remaining
- sourcesystem_entity
  - sourcesystem: name of the source system (e.g: crm, erp)
  - entity: exact name from the source system
  - Example: crm_customer_system -> Customer informations from crm system

### Gold Rules
- All names should meet meaningful business alligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix
- category_entity
  - category: describes the role of a table such as dim (dimension) or fact (Fact table)
  - entity: name of a table, aligned with the business domain (e.g: customer, product, sales)
  - Example:
    - dim_customer -> dimension table of customer data
    - fact_sales -> Fact table containing sales transaction


| Pattern      | Meaning         | Example                        |
|-----------   |------------     |------------                    |
| dim_         | Diention Table  | dim_customer dim_product       |
| Fact         | fact Table      | fact_sales                     |
| agg_         | Aggregate table | agg_customers agg_sales_monthly| 

## Column naming convention

### Surrogate Keys 
- All primary keys in dimension tables must use the suffix _key
- table_name_key
  - table_name: refers to the table name or entity the key belongs to
  - _key: a suffix indicating that this column is a surrogate key
  - e.g: customer_key, surrogate key in dim_customer table
### Technical columns
All technical columns must start with the prefix dwh_ following by the descriptive name indicating the column purpose.
- dwh_column_name
  - dwh_: prefix exclusively for system generated metadada
  - column_name: descriptive name indicating the column purpose
  - example: dwh_load_date -> system generated column used to store the date when the record was loaded
 
##Store Procedure
- All store procedure used for loading data must follow the naming pattern: load_layer
  - layer: represent the layer behind the loaded such as bronze, silver and gold
  - e.g:
    - load_bronze -> store procedure into load data for bronze layer
    - load_silver -> store procedure into load data for silver layer
